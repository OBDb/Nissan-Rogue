generations:
  - name: "First Generation (S35)"
    start_year: 2008
    end_year: 2013
    description: "The original Nissan Rogue was introduced as a compact crossover SUV, sharing its platform with the Nissan Sentra but with increased height and available all-wheel drive. The exterior featured relatively conservative styling with smooth contours and a conventional SUV silhouette. Powered exclusively by a 2.5L four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and available in front-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations. The interior offered seating for five with no third-row option, featuring straightforward design and controls. Available features included a premium audio system, navigation, rearview camera, and Bluetooth connectivity. Standard safety features included stability control, anti-lock brakes, and six airbags. Despite being Nissan's entry in the rapidly growing compact crossover segment, the first-generation Rogue was notable for its car-like handling, comfortable ride, and value proposition rather than distinctive styling or off-road capability."

  - name: "Second Generation (T32)"
    start_year: 2014
    end_year: 2020
    description: "The second-generation Rogue featured more distinctive styling with Nissan's V-motion grille design, LED daytime running lights, and more sculpted body lines. Built on the jointly developed Renault-Nissan Common Module Family (CMF) platform, it offered improved rigidity and refinement. Continued with the 2.5L four-cylinder engine now producing 170-175 horsepower (depending on model year) paired with an improved continuously variable transmission (CVT) featuring simulated gear ratios for more natural acceleration feel. Interior space and flexibility improved substantially with the innovative EZ Flex seating system and Divide-N-Hide cargo management. Available features expanded to include a 360-degree Around View Monitor camera system, power liftgate, dual-zone climate control, and NissanConnect infotainment with navigation and mobile apps capability. A significant addition was the available third-row seat on certain trims, though this feature was discontinued after 2017. Safety technology advanced considerably throughout this generation, eventually including Nissan Safety Shield technologies such as automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning, and rear cross-traffic alert. A hybrid variant was briefly offered from 2017-2019, combining a 2.0L four-cylinder engine with an electric motor for improved efficiency. A significant refresh in 2017 brought updated styling, interior refinements, and additional safety features. The second-generation Rogue became Nissan's bestselling model in the United States, appealing to families with its combination of practicality, technology, and value pricing."

    end_year: null
    description: "The current Rogue features dramatically more sophisticated styling with a bold interpretation of Nissan's V-motion grille, split-level lighting with slim upper LED daytime running lights separated from the main headlights, floating roof design, and more squared-off proportions creating a more substantial presence. Built on an updated version of the CMF platform with increased use of high-strength steel and aluminum components, it offers improved structural rigidity and reduced weight. Initially powered by an updated 2.5L four-cylinder engine producing 181 horsepower, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) with improved efficiency and responsiveness. For 2022, a new 1.5L variable-compression turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 201 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque became available, delivering improved performance and efficiency. The interior represents a significant upgrade with higher quality materials, more sophisticated design including a 'floating' center console, and advanced technology including an available 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, 10.8-inch head-up display, and 9-inch touchscreen infotainment system with wireless Apple CarPlay. Safety technology has expanded substantially with standard Nissan Safety Shield 360 including automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, high beam assist, and rear automatic braking, with available ProPILOT Assist with Navi-link offering enhanced semi-autonomous driving capability. The third-generation Rogue maintains its focus on family-friendly features with improved rear seat space, tri-zone climate control, and thoughtful storage solutions throughout the cabin, positioning it as a technology-forward, premium-feeling option in the highly competitive compact crossover segment."
